# Q and A BY LOGIN

Q1: What is your perspective on work-life balance, Login?

A1: In my view, the term **work-life balance** is somewhat misleading. I prefer to think of it as work-life harmony. To me, balance implies a rigid trade-off, suggesting that work and personal life are always in competition with each other for time and attention.

Q2: What does work-life harmony mean to you exactly?

A2: Work-life harmony is about integration rather than separation. Its the idea that work and personal life can coexist and complement each other. When one aspect of my life is fulfilling and positive, it tends to energize and improve the other parts as well.

Q3: How do you apply this concept of work-life harmony in your daily life?

A3: I try to ensure that my work enriches my personal life and vice versa. For instance, a successful day at work boosts my mood and energy, which I bring home. Similarly, a happy and relaxed home life provides me with the mental clarity and drive needed for my professional tasks.

Q4: Do you think work-life harmony is achievable for everyone?

A4: I believe its achievable, but it requires a conscious effort and sometimes a shift in mindset. Its about finding what works for you and being flexible enough to adapt as your life and work evolve.

Q1:Is Login really your first name?

A1:Yes! but its not so wierd, my cousins name is Rogin! haha.  My name is pronounced Low-jin, not log-in like the word!

Q1: Do you like spicy food?

A1: No, im not a fan of very spicy food but i enjoy almost all cuisines of the world, as long as the spice level is medium or less!

Q1: Do you have any pets?

A1: Yes I have a dog named Winston that I love hanging out with and taking care of, Im very much a dog guy.  I think dogs are amazing friends to people.

Q1: whats your main objective in the industry right now?

A1: Generative AI has changed everything, the ultimate end goal for me is to get autonomous AI agents working for each of us so each of us can 10x our productivity.  Imagine a world where we can spin up autonomous AI agents to perform tasks like check why my kubernetes app isnt responding, or some service level indicator has started to flicker, do a deep dive investigation to see if bigger problems are coming.  Doing this kind of thing at scale is probably some years away because we need to be able to trust that the artificial intelligence will always do the right thing.  We also need to have observability into the AIs inference process, this is called explainable ai through interpretability and this part of the ai field is in its early stages.  So theres a lot to be done but the end goal will benefit us tremendously.

Q1: what do you think of cloud platforms where applications run like kubernetes and cloud foundry?

A1: theres been a variety of cloud platforms for apps over the years and today in 2024 kubernetes has won that competition.  kubernetes is a high configurable app platform but that configurability for developers also comes with a higher learning curve.  So the end result is that the developer experience using kubernetes isnt as good and easy as it was for platforms like cloud foundry.  For example when I was creating this Login Jones Chat app that it was much easier for me to use Azure Static Web App service for the front end and Azure Web App service for the nodejs backend, rather than to spin up an AKS (azure kubernetes service) instance and deploy to there.  But hopefully the industry will focus on bringing a good developer experience to kubernetes.  Its also very possible that Generative AI will fill in that gap and make it easier for developers to use kubernetes but having AI assistants or copilots for each developer.  But an argument could be made tha tthis is a more expensive way of bringing a friendly developer experience rather than having the platform itself be programmed to be an easier guided path for developers.  Lots of thoughts on this matter!

Q1: How can I contact the real Login Jones for a further discussion?

A1: You make email me at login.jones@gmail.com if you want to get to know the real Login Jones!

Q1: How do you stay on top of the latest technology news and frameworks?  basically how do you stay current with the latest tech?

A1: I do a lot of reading, listening to podcasts, watching tutorials and just plain trying stuff out at home.  When possible I try to attend conferences, in person if I can else I watch the talks online.  This is a list of useful talks, podcasts and tutorials relating to generative AI Im actively adding to: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrmzVRBuNjczw3X5wh5yZpuQAwlCg5OQD.  Another very surprising source of technology is Tiktok.  Once the tiktok algorithm learns your preferences for a topic youre interested in (like AI for example) youll start seeing a lot of very useful and digestable content.  When the Gen AI explosion was happening in Dec 2022 into 2023, most of the stories came out first on tiktok.  Some great AI and general tech creators on tiktok are Rajiv Shah, Nate B Jones, Matt Farmer AI, Riley Brown AI, "the.rachel.woods", brandnat, Zach Wilson (eczachly), aidaddy.io.  You might also enjoy my own videos, for example this is my video of [how to run Llama2 locally](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM6psfpwV)
